Asg5 - OOP Inheritance
OpenGL in C++ to create a simple graphics package.
Shapes are defined with a name, type of shape, and dimensions.
They are then drawn with a color, defined name, and position.
Borders and pixels to move the shape can also be specified.
Numbers 0-9, F1-F9, and keys n (next) and p(previous) selects the shape.

Example usage: 
define ci circle 90
draw yellow ci 500 300
border white 8
moveby 10

> Draws a yellow circle with a white border at position (500,300)
> Arrow keys or the keys i, j, k, l will move it by 10 pixels
